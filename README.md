# Notes Application

> This is the backend of a note taking application made by Arnaud Kaderi while learning React through [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

I have made two deployments on [Render](https://notes-backend-tdpp.onrender.com/) and on [Fly.io](https://polished-wind-2400.fly.dev/)

The frontend of this application can be found in the `notes` repository
